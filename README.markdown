#Waterloo Tools

##About

This is a website which manages a collection of tools for University of Waterloo students, by University of Waterloo students. Any edits are welcome! Drag to change the order! Edits will be reviewed by an admin and then accepted and made active. At any time anyone can view all the submitted revisions by clicking on the Revisions button.

##Steal my code!

If you are not a Waterloo student, you are free to use this code for your own school! It's really easy. It will (probably) run on any server with PHP 5. Just please contribute back any enhancements that you make :)

###Setup
- run ./set\_password.sh \<password\>
- Make sure there is a directory called `data` with write permissions
- Make sure your web server has permission to create a file called `rss.xml` in the root folder.
- If you want to build the documentation, you need to install node.js, Pygents and docco, then run ./build\_doc.sh

##Contribute

If you would like to contribute to this project, you can take on one of the following tasks:

- Make me a logo :D
- Make things look better
- Make it possible for an admin to delete a revision
- Set up something to track clicks and maybe sort links by popularity
- extract common parts of the field and entry editor out
- better revisons picker + date + description visible when selected
- transform the entry data to use a Data array instead of a hashmap of name to datum; sort the data differently than right now
